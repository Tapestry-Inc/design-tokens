## ToDo

- Add semantic release https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/

## Concepts to Discuss

Tailwind

Each brand's version of Tailwind needs to use [PurgeCSS](https://purgecss.com/) in the same repository where all HTML is stored. This is due to PurgeCSS needing access to the HTML where the classes are used in order to compare it with the classes contained in the CSS.

Global Components and Theming

To support this, these global components must be designed to incorporate a style mapping schema that brands can configure. These configurations would live in the Design Tokens package. But having to define a configuration for each component and for each brand will quickly make for a bloated system that is hard to maintain.

Instead, this should be done by creating theming schema that is agnostic to components. This entails defining a token's name by its general function instead of visual style or category. For example:

Colors as applied to text:

| Visual            | Function       |
| ----------------- | -------------- |
| text-red          | text-error     |
| text-black        | text-prominent |
| text-neutral-dark | text-base      |
| text-grey-cool    | text-subtle    |

Fonts:

| Visual          | Function     |
| --------------- | ------------ |
| font-serif      | font-base    |
| font-sans-serif | font-heading |
| font-helvetica  | font-utility |

So a rule used by a component would go from this:

```css
button {
  color: var(--text-neutral-dark);
  font-family: var(--font-serif);
}
```

to this:

```css
button {
  color: var(--text-base);
  font-family: var(--font-utility);
}
```

And a brand can configure this component by mapping their tokens to the theme functions:

```json
{
  "color": {
    "text": {
      "base": "{color.neutral.light}"
    }
  },
  "typography": {
    "font": {
      "utility": "{font.bembo}"
    }
  }
}
```

## Benefits

- Centralize control over brand style
- Ease in enforcing UI consistency across platforms.
- Automate generation of brand-themed assets like CSS & JavaScript variables, SVG icons, and CSS utility classes.
- Structured adoption through versioned packages.

## Common Style Primitives

- Colors (inform text, borders, backgrounds, icons, etc.)
- Spacing scale (informs padding, margin, etc.)
- Font Families
- Text scale (size and line-height combos, agnostic of usage)
- Border scale
- Breakpoints
- Transitions
- SVG icons
