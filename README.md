# Design Tokens System

Design tokens are style primitives (color, typography, spacing, etc.) that are stored in a platform/code/use-agnostic system, enabling greater efficiency in  maintaining and scaling a brand's style.

## Benefits

- Centralize control over brand style
- Ease in enforcing UI consistency across platforms.
- Automate generation of brand-themed assets like CSS & JavaScript variables, SVG icons, and CSS utility classes.
- Structured adoption through versioned packages.

## Common Style Primitives

- Colors (inform text, borders, backgrounds, icons, etc.)
- Spacing scale (informs padding, margin, etc.)
- Font Families
- Text scale (size and line-height combos, agnostic of usage)
- Border scale
- Breakpoints 
- Transitions
- SVG icons
